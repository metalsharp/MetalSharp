# Launch Architecture
**Updated:** 2026-09-08


MetalSharp launches games through the C backend and the current MTSP pipeline resolver.

## Flow

```text
Play clicked
  -> renderer calls backend
  -> backend resolves a pipeline
  -> backend syncs/preflights the runtime bottle when one applies
  -> backend builds a LaunchRecipe
  -> backend preflights runtime assets
  -> backend prepares DLLs/env/cache beside the selected executable
  -> selected MTSP route starts the game; internal Steam/Wine/macOS handoffs are used only when the backend selects them
```

## Current Pipelines

| Public route | Backend | Launch path |
|---|---|---|
| VKD3D | Vulkan->Metal | Direct Wine launch with `dxvk/vkd3d-proton` D3D12/11/10/9/DXGI Dll's with updated MoltenVK 1.4.3 dylib/icd |
| **DXMT** | Metal | Direct Wine launch with `dxmt` D3D11/D3D10/DXGI DLLs |
| **DXMT(32)** | Metal | Direct Wine launch with i386 `dxmt` D3D10/D3D10core/DXGI DLLs |
| **Mono/FNA** | Native Mono | Native FNA/XNA/Mono runtime with FNA/XNA assemblies, native dylib staging, FMOD/FAudio/FNA3D shims, and Steamworks shim support |
| **D3DMetal** | Managed GPTK 4 beta 2 | Steam-aware direct launch through MetalSharp Wine 11.17, with game-local D3DMetal DLLs and `prefix-steam` |

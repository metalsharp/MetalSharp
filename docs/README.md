- [Electron IPC Security Contract](architecture/electron-ipc-security.md) - renderer trust boundary, backend allowlist, dependency actions, and updater validation.
- [D3D12 Pipeline Map](architecture/vkd3d-pipeline-map.md) - current VKD3D D3D12 path (vkd3d-proton default, DXMT rollback).
- [D3D10 Pipeline Map](architecture/m10-pipeline-map.md) - current M10 D3D10/DXMT path.
- [D3D9 Pipeline Map](architecture/m9-pipeline-map.md) - current M9 D3D9 route.
- [DXMT and Vulkan Architecture](architecture/dxmt-vulkan-architecture.md) - DXMT/M9-M11 boundaries and Vulkan fallback boundaries.
- [D3D12 Developer Runtime Package](../tools/d3d12-metal-sdk/docs/developer-runtime.md) - self-contained developer SDK tarball layout and publish flow.

## Historical Roadmaps

These files are planning history and should not be treated as the current implementation contract without checking the code and runtime manifests first. Archived roadmaps have moved to `docs/archive/roadmaps/`.

### Active roadmaps (current planning)

- [DXMT Proton-Parity Roadmap](roadmaps/dxmt-proton-parity-roadmap.md)
- [Installer Runtime Roadmap](roadmaps/installer-runtime-roadmap.md)
- [Anti-Cheat Hard Route Roadmap](roadmaps/anticheat-hard-route-roadmap.md)
- [D3D12 Offline ABI Surface Matrix](roadmaps/d3d12-offline-abi-surface-matrix.md)
- [D3D12 Offline Cache Preflight](roadmaps/d3d12-offline-cache-preflight.md)
- [D3D12 Offline Gate Results](roadmaps/d3d12-offline-gate-results.md)

### Archived roadmaps (historical, completed work)

See [archive README](archive/README.md) for the full list. Do not cite archived roadmaps as current contracts.

## Research

- [Proton Runtime Research](research/proton-runtime-research.md)
- [Anti-Cheat Compatibility Boundaries](research/anti-cheat-compatibility-boundaries.md)

## Release

- [Release Signing](release/release-signing.md)

## Bundle Truth Sources

- Release assets live on the [`bundles` GitHub release](https://github.com/aaf2tbz/metalsharp/releases/tag/bundles).
- Manifest-tracked hashes live in [tools/bundles/asset-manifest.tsv](../tools/bundles/asset-manifest.tsv).
- GPTK/D3DMetal is not a MetalSharp bundle asset. D3DMetal uses Homebrew GPTK at `/Applications/Game Porting Toolkit.app` and seeds matched route DLLs into `~/.metalsharp/prefix-gptk` when a D3DMetal bottle is prepared.
- Verify local and remote bundle state with:

```bash
tools/bundles/verify-bundles.sh --release
tools/bundles/verify-bundles.sh --require mac
```

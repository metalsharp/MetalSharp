# How to Build MetalSharp Wine

This guide builds MetalSharp's **Wine 11.17** runtime on macOS with an
**x86_64 Unix host** and **i386 + x86_64 Windows PE support**. On Apple Silicon,
the Unix host runs through Rosetta. This is the 64-bit-host WoW64 configuration;
it does not require a 32-bit macOS runtime.

Build into a separate directory. Do not build over the installed MetalSharp
runtime or use a live Steam prefix for build validation.

## Source and version

Use a **prepared MetalSharp-patched Wine 11.17 source tree**. A public URL and
immutable revision for this exact source snapshot are not yet provided. Obtain
the prepared tree from the maintainer before following these commands. A stock
Wine tree is not a substitute for MetalSharp's loader, graphics integration, and
synchronization changes.

The source directory must contain `configure.ac`, `dlls/`, `include/`, `server/`,
and `tools/`. Keep the source snapshot's checksum/revision with your build logs.
Do not substitute a different runtime solely because it reports Wine 11.17.

This repository carries the reproducible Wine-side x87sidecar integration at
`tools/bundles/wine/0001-x87sidecar-cooperative.patch`. Apply it once to the
prepared source checkout before configuring. The patch adds the cooperative Mach
handshake and re-execs only i386 Windows images through `x87sidecar`; it does not
enable the sidecar globally. Keep the source patch and the sidecar binary at the
same version when producing a runtime bundle.

## What makes this MetalSharp Wine

MetalSharp Wine is a maintained Wine fork carrying **WineForge-derived
integrations**, adapted to the prepared Wine 11.17 source baseline. It is not
just an upstream Wine build with a different name. The prepared tree also
incorporates macOS compatibility work from an additional Wine source baseline;
the list below describes the resulting integration, not a complete per-line
attribution or a claim that every feature originated in WineForge.

### Integrations compiled into Wine

| Integration | Included work and purpose |
| --- | --- |
| D3DMetal module loading | `dlls/ntdll/unix/d3dmetal_loader.c` resolves matching Windows and Unix-side components from `D3DMETAL_RUNTIME_DIR`. This must remain integrated with the normal module loader. |
| D3DMetal macOS presentation | `dlls/winemac.drv/d3dmetal.c` and `d3dmetal_objc.m` connect the Windows graphics implementation to macOS windows and Metal surfaces. The surface interface was adapted for the 11.17 driver baseline. |
| DXMT loading | `dlls/ntdll/unix/dxmt_loader.c` and loader/load-order integration select the DXMT runtime through `DXMT_RUNTIME_DIR`, while retaining a separate M12 lane. |
| PE/Unix graphics bridge compatibility | The `msdxcompat_loader` components and Unix-library loading adjustments support the matching PE DLL/native bridge arrangement. Windows module paths and host library paths are not interchangeable. |
| macOS synchronization | MSYNC is compiled into both `server/msync.c` and `dlls/ntdll/unix/msync.c`. Client and server must agree on this implementation; both read `WINEMSYNC`. Do not mix a server from another build with this client. |
| WoW64 host and startup compatibility | The x86_64 host includes both PE architectures, corresponding loader/virtual-memory integration, and prefix bootstrap fixes. Fresh-prefix Wineboot and service startup are part of validation, not optional packaging details. |
| Cooperative x87 acceleration | `dlls/ntdll/unix/loader.c` hands i386 Windows images to the bundled arm64 `x87sidecar` through its cooperative Mach-port protocol. The hook is enabled only when the launcher sets `ROSETTA_X87_PATH`; do not enable it for other graphics routes. |
| Launcher compatibility | WineForge-derived launcher/security integration touches `kernelbase`, `advapi32`, process loading, and related service handling. Preserve these patches together rather than copying isolated DLLs from another Wine installation. |
| macOS driver integration | Window, event, keyboard, and driver interface changes accompany the loader and presentation work. Native modules must be built against the same source headers and server protocol. |

The additional source-baseline work used to make this runtime functional
includes the macOS host/loader foundation, paired client/server synchronization,
Windows-to-Unix module-loading compatibility, and Wineboot/service bootstrap
integration. The prepared tree combines these with the WineForge-derived
loader, launcher, and presentation adaptations. A reproducible attribution list
requires the source snapshot and patch history; filenames alone do not establish
which upstream contributed an individual change. Preserve all original source
copyright and license notices when preparing or distributing it.

### Enabled features and separately supplied payloads

The configure command below enables Vulkan/OpenGL, CoreAudio, GnuTLS, FFmpeg,
GStreamer, SDL, OpenCL, Samba NetAPI, fonts, and other host services. These are
build dependencies and enabled Wine features, not all MetalSharp-specific
patches. WineDbg is also built; disabling Wine tests does not mean removing the
debugger.

D3DMetal **integration code is part of the Wine build**, but Apple's D3DMetal
DLLs/framework are a separate, appropriately obtained payload. The tested local
arrangement uses GPTK 4 beta 2 with:

- `D3DMETAL_RUNTIME_DIR` pointing to the payload root containing `wine/` and
  `external/`.
- `D3DMETAL_FRAMEWORK_PATH` pointing to
  `external/D3DMetal.framework/D3DMetal`, the executable rather than the framework
  directory.
- Matching D3DMetal PE DLLs staged beside the selected game executable.

Likewise, DXMT DLLs and native `winemetal.so` bridges, VKD3D-Proton/DXVK DLLs,
and MoltenVK are built or obtained separately and paired with this Wine host.
The DXMT baseline used in this work is v0.80. Do not assume `make install` has
provided these graphics payloads or configured per-game routing.

## Necessary tools

- An Apple Silicon Mac with Rosetta 2.
- Xcode Command Line Tools and a macOS SDK.
- Git, GNU Make, Autoconf, Automake, Bison, Flex, pkg-config, and Python 3.
- LLVM/Clang for x86_64 Mach-O host code.
- MinGW-w64 compilers for both i686 and x86_64 Windows PE code.
- Apple's `codesign`, `file`, `otool`, and `lipo` for validation.
- The pinned arm64 cooperative `x87sidecar` release asset.

Install the host tools with Homebrew:

```bash
xcode-select --install  # Skip if already installed.
brew install autoconf automake bison flex pkgconf llvm mingw-w64 python
```

On Apple Silicon, install Rosetta if it is not already available:

```bash
softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
```

Confirm the SDK and cross-compilers are available:

```bash
xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-path
xcrun --find codesign
command -v i686-w64-mingw32-gcc
command -v x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
```

## Host dependencies

The compiler can run natively on Apple Silicon, but **every library linked into
Wine's Unix side must provide an x86_64 slice**. Installing an arm64 Homebrew
library does not satisfy this requirement. Use a prepared x86_64 dependency
prefix, or build these dependencies for x86_64 before configuring Wine. Headers
must match the installed libraries; do not mix unrelated versions.

| Feature | Required development files / runtime libraries |
| --- | --- |
| Fonts | FreeType |
| TLS | GnuTLS and its transitive libraries |
| Media | FFmpeg (`avformat`, `avcodec`, `avutil`) |
| GStreamer | GStreamer core, video, audio, tag and base; GLib/GObject/GIO and their dependencies |
| Controllers | SDL2-compatible headers and library |
| Windows authentication | Samba NetAPI (`netapi.h`, `libnetapi.dylib`) and `ntlm_auth` |
| Vulkan | Vulkan headers/loader and the compatible MoltenVK driver |
| OpenGL/EGL | macOS OpenGL support and any required EGL development files |
| OpenCL | OpenCL headers and the macOS OpenCL framework |
| Localization | gettext/libintl |
| System integration | macOS SDK CoreAudio, CUPS, pcap and pthread support |

The examples below expect these files in `$DEPS/include`, `$DEPS/lib`,
`$DEPS/bin`, and `$DEPS/lib/pkgconfig` (or `share/pkgconfig`). Dependency recipes
and binaries are separate prerequisites, not downloaded by these commands.
Check representative libraries before proceeding:

```bash
file "$DEPS/lib/libgnutls.dylib" "$DEPS/lib/libnetapi.dylib"
lipo -archs "$DEPS/lib/libgnutls.dylib"
```

Do not force successful configure-cache results to hide missing libraries.
Resolve missing headers, symbols, or architecture mismatches instead.

## Configure and build

Use absolute paths without spaces for the build/dependency directories. Set
`SRC` to the prepared source tree and `DEPS` to your x86_64 dependency prefix.
The example uses an external SSD; substitute an existing writable volume.

install -m 0755 "$X87SIDECAR_EXTRACT/x87sidecar" "$PREFIX/bin/x87sidecar"
"$PREFIX/bin/x87sidecar" --probe
```

Stop if configure or make fails. Inspect `config.log` and the configure summary
before treating the build as complete. If dependency discovery needs explicit
`GNUTLS_CFLAGS`/`GNUTLS_LIBS`, `FFMPEG_*`, `GSTREAMER_*`, or `SDL2_*` values,
point them at the matching x86_64 development prefix.

Do not replace `--enable-archs=i386,x86_64` with `--enable-win64`: that would not
build the intended dual-PE runtime. Use a fresh build directory when changing
source snapshots, architecture, or dependency versions.

## Validate without touching Steam

```bash
export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH="$DEPS/lib:$PREFIX/lib:$PREFIX/lib/wine/x86_64-unix"
"$PREFIX/bin/x87sidecar" --probe
"$PREFIX/bin/wine" --version
file "$PREFIX/bin/wine" "$PREFIX/bin/wineserver"
file "$PREFIX/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/ntdll.dll"
file "$PREFIX/lib/wine/i386-windows/ntdll.dll"
otool -L "$PREFIX/lib/wine/x86_64-unix/ntdll.so"

# A new prefix, never ~/.metalsharp/prefix-steam:
export WINEPREFIX="$(mktemp -d "$ROOT/smoke-prefix.XXXXXX")"
export WINEARCH=wow64
export WINESERVER="$PREFIX/bin/wineserver"
export WINEMSYNC=1
"$PREFIX/bin/wine" wineboot -u
"$PREFIX/bin/wine" cmd /c ver
"$PREFIX/bin/wineserver" -w
```

Expect `wine-11.17`, x86_64 Mach-O host binaries, and both x86_64 and i386 PE
DLLs. These commands are smoke checks, not a complete game-compatibility test.
MSYNC is selected at process/server startup; changing `WINEMSYNC` does not
reconfigure an already-running server. Never use `wineserver -k` against a live
Steam prefix to validate a build.

## Packaging is a separate step

`make install` creates a development installation. It does not produce a
relocatable MetalSharp runtime bundle. Audit dependency load paths and include
required redistributable host libraries before moving it to another machine.
Preserve applicable licenses and source notices. Sign final native binaries
after any Mach-O modifications and verify the resulting app signature.

DXMT, VKD3D-Proton/DXVK, MoltenVK routing metadata, and D3DMetal payloads are
separate graphics components; building Wine does not install them. Likewise,
Unity games commonly include their own managed assemblies and embedded Mono.
Do not copy arbitrary game DLLs into Wine to complete this build.
